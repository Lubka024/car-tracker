# Car Tracker

## The purpose of your application 
 I want to create an app to track company car usage. The app should manage multiple cars and record each rideś purpose, destination, and end mileage.

## About your application
Based on the application intent, with Contember, you will build a custom management application to track company car usage. This application will allow you to manage multiple cars and record details of each ride, such as purpose, destination, and end mileage. You will be able to create, update, and delete car records, as well as view and manage ride information for each car. The application will provide an intuitive user interface and leverage the power of Contember's GraphQL API to efficiently store and retrieve data.

## Roles
### Driver
The Driver role is responsible for using company cars for various purposes. They are required to record details of each ride, including the purpose, destination, and end mileage. Drivers have access to view and update their own ride information but cannot modify other drivers' records or manage the car inventory.
